This is written in a tool & idiomatic venacular built for ùüö audiences. 

### 1. seekErrs
* 2(A): young engineering or science students who are starting their careers
* 2(B): older versions of the same
* 2(C): self-taught non-credentialled technical people
* 2(E): People who are already employed, but curious

### 2.  valiDaterrs
* 2(A): HR & Recruiting professionals
* 2(B): those companies which seek IT expertise

* 2(E): Education or undergradate opportunities

## how to enroll/play
* limited number of HR hiring firms offering crypto
* questions & answers will be classified by sensitivity, such that there are both public and vaulted.  access to vaulted information requires coin staking and both agents build detailed profiles of questions & answers between candidates using github issues.

* can use different language models to process the same neutral data format.

## ü§ì Technical Detail
üôè Candy Date is consuming the good ideas from my earlier work \_b00t\_ related to simplification of complex 'highly-technical' machine-learning stacks device-deployable multi-os build & packaging system using WASM (web assembler) which allows polyglot coding between Rust, TypeScript, Python and C++ (at least these) and a full build of Linux & OCI containers running the deno serverless engine.  If this information made sense to you then you may be qualified to read the [techstack.md]()


I'm rewriting my ideas from [http://github.com/elasticdotventures/\_b00t\_]() into CandÍ≠µ.‚ÖÜaùï•e(¬ÆÔ∏è¬ÆÔ∏è) v0.0.1 using cargo - second attempt at a universal installer for less/least technical people.  But this is mostly intended for technical recruiting initially. 


## Present obstacles
``` 
# installing gh repo is bumpy.  that happens pretty earily in the install. 
gh repo clone elasticdotventures/candydated0txyz

```

üôè Please be patient. Rome was not built in a day.

## Candy Date Operational Summary

üëã I'm just starting to organize this for peer validation.  
üôè Thank you for your time.  Please checkout contribute or follow me on twitter, linkedin, whatever social media you happen to use. 

To help visualize the game-format and operation of Candy Date it is helpful to envision a game of telephone with an AI Large Language model in the center relaying answers between two parties 

## Simplified Operation

Please realize the process as described below is happening for many weight attributes per candidate and validator (organization) to improve accurate. 

```mermaid
flowchart LR

A2[valiDatErr] -->|has job| B(agent)
A1[seekErr] -->|get job| B(agent)
B --> C{is  good match?}
C -->|Yes| D[keep match, get more]
C -->|Love| E[Let's get IT on ... date time!]
C --->|No| F[Sorry about that .. Why?]
F -->|Dunna, Just don't| Fx0[ignore & try again]
F -->|Don't like Role| Fx10[Discard Roles like this]
F -->|Don't like Company| Fx20[Blacklist Company]
F -->|Don't like Area| Fx30[Create Address Filter]


```
The instructions to the agent are to perform speed dating rounds with many collaborative agents periodically signing in and answer questions.
The rational-skill & location & attribute matching & job filtering.  

Once the agents are primed they can tear through and analyize why they removed particular roles (conversationally).  Each persons private information is put into one system and it is only provided to job roles which are likely to be high matches for both parties.  This allows a canidate to talk back at the job. 

At this stage i'm still building the installer since this needs to run on peoples computers or business networks and connect to single service sign-on settings and whatnot it's fairly complex.

# Aspirational goals
Some of the aspirational goals of this repo is to produce artificats that appear in every app store.  The initial configuration(s) selected must be broad enough that they can begin & ultimately pass the certification processes for Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc. A software project like this is never complete.

üôè the goal is to eliminate the toil, and setup what are effectively install a plurality "spinning-rims", once the software is setup and installed we'll have lots of features but before that we need to do a bunch of foundational cybersecurity housekeeping tasks to be able to pass future ISO27001 software audits and offer corporate organization SSO for organizational crypto-wallet & gamified hiring process with AI natural language agent in the middle - it's a project. 

This project specifically uses the NLP LLM generative AI to perform data-privacy and anonymouse.üê≠  Your information remains encrypted on your machine or in your github.com or similar vault.  For companies hiring technical people this system allows you to post job descriptions directly into IpFS under your own organizational repo.  

One aspect that is difficult about launching a system like this is both 'want job' and 'have job' persons (seekErrs & valiDatErrs respectively) must arrive at roughly the same time.  To mitigate this requirement this is being designed inside out. You get as far into the process as you can.  Use github issues. 

### TLDR: Advanced Route (present)


* install WSL2 ubuntu 22.04 LTS
    * ü§ì reference https://ubuntu.com/wsl
    * ü§ìüëç as of writing these documents describe older versions 20.04 (please modify)
    * ü§ìüëç this may work on older builds but I can't promise anything, please report success

* install RUST using rustup
    * ü§ì reference (below)

* i need to figure out how to install a lot of RUST packages in a workspace, but this will ultimately a system within a system.  so the user experience starts with the installer. 

* every module, sugar-syntax, etc. should have an install.sh
* FUTURE: install.sh will be convered by bats (bourne again test scripts)
* the big challenge is starting from a mostly bear system. 

```bash

~./install.sh

# this is easy because it means there can be a local system template created by
rm ~/.candy
git clone --template /mnt/c/0de/candydated0txyz 

# now grab the repo using git, or gh client
git clone  /mnt/c/0de
gh repo clone ...

# 
cd ~/.candy 
cd /mnt/c/0de/candy

# minimal getting started, begin tutorial:
cargo install 
# ü§ì: this should automatically do all the commands below.

cargo test
cargo run


```

### ... progress

# Menu driving VOTE: 

It is asynchronous social chat including organizational survivorship & good-will (how many people would be likely to work there again, or return to work under which conditions) hive mind survey of technical people.

This application is incredibly well suited to curate the internal organizational technologies & share + curate systems documentation (including periodically holding & decisionally wagering different forms of currency based on outcomes)



Not everybody who will arrive at this page knows what Github, crypto-currency, discord, programming and other details of technical stacks. I will try and present the topics gently.  Not everybody will understand the benefits of a Compiler Linter, or what a real-time continuous code-live share jam sessions. 

So if you are technically inclined or not, please let me explain what you are reading in the broadest terms

greetings to CandÍ≠µ.‚ÖÜaùï•e(tm) v0.0.1


## Contribute
see [contribute.md]()

Even non-programmers will be needed to fill this system and build out it's synapses with regional hiring jargon & nomenclature.  Agents who are hiring people can represent employers.  Especially people who do HR or Recruiting tasks for a living, or anybody who is technical that is looking for a new or better job role and would rather than the AI autoresponder feel the sting of rejection. 

A need functional assesment model - regional questions of industry specific jargon (such as "office in CBD" for Melbourne VIC, AU) regional ways to categorize communities and clarifications by language models to ensure they are properly aligned and performing accurately & efficiently. 

Examples of commutes and make better decisions, questions and answers that are selected by employers to assess candidates as Alpha & Beta validation testers for the system. 



## TODO: Setup Affiliate Referral Code
fn roll_ü•ê.seekerrs(): {
    Err("seek error:  sorry, this system either isn't online yet. or appears to be under construction at the moment & offline. perhaps it is still being built.")
    // but yes, someday! 
    }

## What is an Epoch (‚åö) // sounds like: ep-clocks
^-- memetic: Epclock or Epoch is a frequency based date or deadline. 

An EPOCH is used in crypto-coin decentralized organizations conceptually is an area for engagement, business cycle, popular network generated or used questions.  In depending on the cultures an epoch means one day, or one year, or one moon phase on any number of astrological zodiac signs. 

During dates both sides ask & answer questions (screened by the AI) in either voice transcription or command line written responses, short responses (more like tweets) the system records their answers, and in the future answers related questions automatically.  During the process by truthfully answering long and short term answers for both party to provide recruiting packages know as LOVE.üíå and LOLE.üç≠ at different EPCLOCKS.‚åö  both accure during the relationship.  Which are a form of gratuity for the process (no gratuity is wasting our time) and preloading or fast tracking the 
CandÍ≠µ.‚ÖÜaùï•e(tm) process includes multiple concurrently running EPOCHS & cultural festivus (community bulletin board, for example on mastodon) smalltalk, limiting the social engagement.  The summary bot might say "I scanned 56 job advertisments, here are the top 3, would you like me to follow up"



fn roll_üìÖ.daterrs() {
    # flexible epochs
        * mayan()
        * lunar() .. one moon
        * julian()
}

## Conceptual
High speed "pay for priority" the higher bounties offered the better ranked engineers, more questions per epoch, such that in the game mechanics each player, each epoch gets a biscuit.üç™ as a participation toys.ü™Ä (toys,or trophys are granted for participation). 

to register to be an affiliate and receive coin for referring people, simply use the fork repo, add your organization, or your profile(s) resumes into the vault.  
job the most appropriate resume will be selected.  keep the system up to date with how your job satisfaction is going by providing positive or negative sentiment.

## TODO: Markdown Resume Lint
one entry, automated form-filler and job-scanning application auto-pilot with connections to your favorite job board. 

* Register yourself by forking this repo, adding your own interpretation of what a Markdown Resume LINT. 

## Large Language Models
Large Language Models such as GPT3
* GPT-Neo or similar 


```

```

## Crypto: Tokenomics
Both systems trade DOTS and LOLE's based on the acceptance or rejectance/outcome of matchings.  LOLE's limited or long term engagements LOLE's (üç≠) measure a date from the time of the first auto-response, a public record of employment of a mutually agreed upon deadline, and subsequent re-negotiation tool that ensures pay equity within a group but also selects one or more winners and losers, with the losers.  DOTS refers to Polkadot a cross-chain 

 This is intended to be an AI Generative Language Model driven crypto-coin driven Word-Token find-hire-work application/technology stack - "interactive assistant & autoresponder" 

Setup a free Github Account to sign up & engage/submit issues.
The first epoch will be bringing structure and detail to this project.  I plan to use Rust/Cargo WASM run in Deno-containers so this setup needs to be opinionated.  Ultimately it's something that will be in the microsoft windows store as a WSL2 image/distribution.

I'm presently working on a http://vscode.dev approach to deploy an individual vault-secured AI Large Language Module auto-responder for job solicitation & auto-responder matching interface. 

It's an onboarding process that gets a person enrolled into a company (so for example on discord, or tweets them about a job, this is an engagement auto-responder)

This is a novel Machine learning stack, inspired from my earlier attempt at _b00t_ this version is built principally on the RUST / WASM language using some Python and TypeScript, that estabishes a github security vault to store cryptographic coin ERC-20 wallet keys.  (ERC-20: is a standard type of crypto-currency wallet that is compatible with browsers via the metamask software.) 

``` Task: Sign your Wallet

Go to 
```

The purpose of this respository is to establish a foundational document and source of truth for the project in a version control system.  

# Keep it simplest terms:
* organizations (called validators) post dates
* candidates seek dates
^--- Candy Date .. CandÍ≠µ.‚ÖÜaùï•e(tm) may you find what you seek. 
* the system is efficient, the fees are very low, and the candidates are pre-screened.  it will take probably 6-10 weeks to build the prototype system, or something that resembles a prototype?

```
git clone --template ssh://github.com/fungibled0tfarm/CandÍ≠µ.‚ÖÜaùï•e

cargo test
cargo run
```

# Task: Can you join Discord? Matrix.Org? 
Sometimes describing something is boring and its easier to just get in and learn something new.  What needs to happen, track survey, the best way to do this would be to join Discord.  Twitter Polls, and other engagement tools.   Certain environments like discord have features such as emojis in chat which can be used for voting and governance of an organization.  

# Triz Task: Follow the rule of 3
Each system should ultimately have 3 connections Many-Factor, not just multi-factor systems such as 2FA are insufficient.  The rule of 3 states that having a minimum of 3, ideally six or more redundant ways to measure.  

# How the bot works:
The bot will camp a variety of online communities and monitor profiles, and curate data on people who have indicated they may be looking for a role. 

If you just want to get started.  
* install vscode or go to http://vscode.dev
^--- this url needs to start an instance, that is what i'm building.

```

```

... Later (after an instance is running), the person has earned some coin and is connected to one or more messaging channels they can start meeting candidates. 

Once you fork this repo, you'll want to run cargo install
```
gh repo clone ssh://...
sudo apt get cargo

```
... ... Much Later




If the person arriving here is an engineering student, or have skill in WASM interoperability between { Python, TypeScript Vue/3, Rust } systems interfaces this repository is accepting [contribute.md] to participate.  This will consume & scan social profiles to see companies who are hiring and engage them for coins.  The entire system includes a personal bot-driven synaptic data-storage & key-recovery mechanism (personal information management, journal) that acts as an interactive intellectual match-maker for a wide variety of technical positions (candidate & company attribute based survey screening & social pairing, potentially a reality-tv show)

If netflix, or amazon, or disney wanted to setup a candÍ≠µ.‚ÖÜaùï•e they would fork this template and create a public version of this at their public github and add their company name to the root such as:
```
/disney

```

I am keen to know your thoughts on my experiment.  You do not need to read the entire thing in one attempt.  I am attempting to articulate the plan & goal for this repo in a laymens technical terms. #Testerrs are wanted! 

My "conventional" resume is http://bit.ly/resume-brianhorakh

This is my candÍ≠µ.‚ÖÜaùï•e find-hire-work assistant concept in development (project of the week, sketch).   collaborative highly technical persons recruiting and find-hire-work app. 

Hi, I think this whole hiring finding talent approach is broken. 
At least here in Victoria, AU. I think it is broken the way Australian and global companies hire and I want to fix it. 

This document will describe a system for introducing candidates on Candy Dates using the version control system known as git & github.

Thing of this as a new form of mating ritual, reality survivor build a startup exercise.  The startup is designed to enroll people who are seeking to hire it. 

The service is presented in this document for non-technical HR people & recruiters what a github README.  In the future more interactive videos and whatnot but the tutorial needs to be built first.  Big companies will probably need to ask your Corporate IT to setup SAML SSO integration with your Microsoft Azure AD domain or at least have access to setup email from an organization domain such as @google.com rather than @gmail.  But offering a plurality of ways to authenticate your agency seeking to hire people and simulatenously help the whole community avoid over-disclosure and fight the growing scourage of smishing, by providing a beacon for organizations to maintain friendly relationships with candidates a small stipend, based on their progression, for taking time to review.  For IT or generally 'engineering' people this is a substantial problem in specialized industries.

How to apply & free initial screening for Candy Date, a HR/Recruiter crypto-currency Gameified Conversational AI bot-driven survey trained Language Model qualification pre-screening of job details.

## Open an issue on any part of the system you would like to comment.

Some people offering coin for consideration, with a pass/fail even on rejection - blockchain employment HR e-records & retention system err$.üòú (Errors, or pronoucned Ugghhs, it's a new sound that you already know - but from the future, err$ sounds like your best Donald Trump uuuuugh, I'm gonna build a giant wall, except in the case of err$ not to be confused with Errors the interactive customer service department). 


## Risks

The commands to setup the system with-ease would require non-technical operators should not hire one or more consultants or utilize resources inside their own organization to enter profiles.   


Anybody should be able to run the whole thing in your browser or install to your PC using WASM.   

What you as perhaps a non-technical HR person won't know how to setup k8s or so this tutorial is designed to be run on an individual PC or target device.   The root of the game is having people post their 

The bot-facilitated conversation is asynchronous, answer once, it gets paid for parrot the answer with high confidence in the future, meaning that both party has time to consider their response in a slow-conversation that might happen over days or weeks (based on the duration of the epoch).  The goals of the system is intended to someday provide a universal basic income UBI for people (the "yei") who contribute & audit the software crypto-cyberspace DAO organizational structure which can be a bit much for people who do not follow the space.  It seeks to be a good-will ambassador & onboarding tool for the Polygon L2, Polkadot and Solana blockchains.   People who are employed and looking for a better job can buy tokens as a way to engage with prospective employers for an assessment/validation or rejection pass-fail summary or score within a batch of candidates "speed interviewing" as a group in cycles known as epochs or hash generations of the game which are tied to various indigenous clocks, iteratively timed exercises.  The game at this point is in a seed stage to build the system and promise everybody who participates in the discussion by commenting future coins to play the machine.  I have a nominal six-figure budget to build the system over the next few weeks & months and am keen to have anybody who is looking for a few extra bucks to consider joining the team as a validator. 

‚õ≤ FounTional : A Repo is technical documentation for a piece of software that you install on your computer, usually in roles which  correspond with via email "recruiter <=> agent <=> company" dynamic of the hiring process.  That is the target audience "lithmus test" for question, time to response, age of account, authenticity of offer (having to stake crypto currency upon a successful outcome with an arbiter Human supervised-AI agent making decisions)

This is  to be reading about or interested in learing how to play "Candy Date" .  filter to determine the likelyhood of a good match selecting staking crypto to do your exercises and offering to share the result for others who may want to administratively review the feedback instead of properly characterizing the state of your Tech Stack internal systems or desires or aspirations.  For candidates, it is a public recognition of which interviews process is broken and one-sided.  For employers, it is an opinionated explanation of how you should be indexing & archiving your job requirements.   You upload your encrypted CV of qualifications or perform tutorials and small exercises. 

This is a technical recruiting application, so it requires some coordination to understand that it is designed to run on your computer, or via a website in your browser our on device. 

 This github, is where you can submit your digital requirements.
 Each time, each party gives an answer.  The answers, profiles, and other data must be verified which service do you want to validate first and linking identities to the wallets of these coins as historical validators for key-shard identity recovery.   Their interest in the long term success of the outcome by validating the decision (such as employment, but possibly others).  Negligible appearance & gratuity payment is gifted crypto-currency for the participation in the live-fire tutorial.  Pay people to give references and use intentional AI LLM model to arrange a date using fictional presently but intended to be real-money equivalent in-game crypto-currency Web3 application. 
 
 This is a bit of Social Art experiment. If written as a novel hopes to proffer a solution of offering coins for data as social capital & value of social data to simplify the match making with me, and *hopefully* other technical candidates who would like to improve the job-seeking experience.  But I'm not making this as a political statement or whatever, other than to say I think this system will work better for technical candidates to become 
 
 For the technically minded people, this is a poly-stack self-installing coin-operated HR hiring & match making system where I/we/yei "the collective us" must pay employers or agents in crypto-coin as bounties/incentives to address my bot instead of me and help them screen me/others better.  Each person runs their own agent, and such that it must ultimately support a wide variety  "plurality" of devices to be successful requires a bit of plumbing and tooling so I need to explain the reason I'm asking people to install my resume. /üòâüòú (at least that is the goal, to ask employers to provide details to an ai llm agent that attempts to match other seekers with a qualified position.) 
 
 The CandÍ≠µ.‚ÖÜaùï•e(tm) functional compiler system is built on the honor policy, you pay people in crypto to read your job based on the preferences & goals they have stated match-making service.  The network pays for successful authentication disclosure, captchas and other nuisances so everybody can earn a few tokens easily.  You must/have or generate an organizational ERC-20 wallet, and you may be asked to provide one or more forms of qualification disclosure (paid de-encryption of matching recruitment data to your needs)

 All the software and requirements in this are FREE to download, there is no cost, the software runs on your computer or in your browser. 
 
/ü§ì "Melvin" represents technical specifications that may not be relevant or difficult to understand outside of knowledge in a specific field.  This system is designed to introduce new skills to the user to play the game as part of an interactive find-aidmmt-hire-work politely named err$ (produced like Errors)

nerd As mentioned in this document will have links appear when this is commited using an RUST cargo action, documentation generation.  Markdown++ is the documentation format with ornamentation for entertainment. 

 This requires people download VS-Code is opinionated dev environment for live-share coding & problem solving exercises & pre-interview and interview transcription q&a pre-screen typewriter with a button that says "ask" and you write a question and it provides better fitment of candidates during Candy Date recruiting exercises. 
 
 Reputation is built by professional operators who screen DALLE-2 driven models for companies they represent in initial screening interviews & ongoing work-from-home or office complex negotiation engagement that is modern post COVID society but also cyber-safety screening.  Recruiting data storage in IT Recruiting & Corporate HR IT systems is usually absolutely horrid so the network will pay them in crypto-currenty to answer profile questions, and they will pay the same coins asynchronously.  People could maintain as many identities as they want professionally and this has the added advantage of long term crypto-key vault recovery 'horcrux' identity sharding.  For now, this REPO will store your secure information in a system known as github git identity private vault.  To do this:

# Steps
 * Setup, github, clone this repo as template - install windows WSL-2 or equivalent command line containerized environment. 

 * Once you have logged into github and made a clone of this repo.  Install VS

 
 Linking crypto wallets and ending the toil of clown coding exercises letting several companies participate in a hiring cycle offering crypto-bounties to their projects. Potentially wager on your mates by providing validation of high level details (reference checks, etc.) for my mates who I've worked with over the years or are seeing this on my LinkedIn profile - this is intended to be a disruptive prototype. ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: If you are in the recruiting-industry you are here playing with disruptive dynamite right now! üß®

 Free to use and payment is strictly on the honor policy in the way the game is played.   The application itself uses the git protocol hash from the log of emoji feedback as a way to index & reward participation. This is common on sites like discord and in organizations. 

I will now attempt to explain that which does not yet exist. 
Please bear with me.  Why I am building this, the audience and how it will be used concurrently.  The types of people who may use this application are technical people who are keen to do tasks or are looking for work. 

üòç Getting rejected while hiring sucks.  Investing the time is distracting.  Interviewing is a full time unpaid job, going through the application, then getting rejected or never hearing back, what is the status blabla, such and such couldn't make xyz meeting blabla. It's bullsh*t. So this coin-operated machine is a crypto-graphic "Staked" (ü•©) system, which means it's pay at the end (after success), honor policy as a way to encourage participation in good-faith, explaining to HR/Recruiters is the primary audience who will read this email, getting referred here from my Job/Spam email filter / offering back with a crypto-api driven AI Auto-Responder &  screening service.   

This is planned as an oregon trail CLI driven system, that can run on any computer or device for universal accessibility with each device having a different role for a many-factor authentication "Mfa" custodial crypto-currency wallets for beginners Gentle Introduction to build your own AI Autoresponder HOWTO. 

Dear Recruiters, I will pay you in crypto-currency to answer these questions and screen these emails better, with a higher degree of word precision and with less repetition (the answers don't change, so this does a better job screening, asynchronously via chat)

 Where companies and employees can upload their encrypted profiles, link their organizational accounts, and have bi-directional robots converstationally take turns in successive-rounds finding and eliminating candidates until a position is filled. 

Don't worry, it's easy to use because everybody starts with 1,000 free tokens sponsored by "Candy Date" Crypto Coin co. a command line driven "cli" / interactive menu driven/run on your own machine. 

You can power the system and generate coins by joining and it is mostly explained below. 

CandÍ≠µ.‚ÖÜaùï•e is a conversational AI that simplifies the review &

In development, it will be operated collectively using this repository and other founTional ("‚õ≤") (founTional: an amaglamation of functional-technical documentation) providing "Sources of Truth" for the stack described herein, how to operate said machine on your own computer, and to take you through the steps of setting up an ERC-20 wallet, and trying to automate as much tedium as possible.  I and possibly others will gladly pay companies to properly screen these opportunities and protect my data & privacy.   The present online recruiting model requires too much disclosure on the candidate and CandÍ≠µ.‚ÖÜaùï•e hopes to fix that by speeding up the "is role a fit" answering simple questions about roles or jobs you represent.
