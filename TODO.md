 As an individual looking for a technical work-remote job - I'm tired of giving up all this information blindly to proprietary job apps.   If you want to make copies that's fine, but my job application from here on is here. 
 
This is a new method of recruiting that requires groups of people (non-scientists, non-system engineers) to be able to setup the tool to prove that it works is another feat entirely.  So this document will define the goals

A crypto-paid bounty & multi-party ETH/Polygon L2 encrypted blockchain record & book keeping negotation system employee-employer work-for-hire match making and data-classification performance analysis system. 

Information is presented in a venacular to potential business & for-hire candidates using CandÍ≠µ.‚ÖÜaùï•e the "latest" (latest: "next idea") processing gamified "find-hire-work = win scenario" system real crypto-job token/game setup interface as an auto-responder to 
my inboxes and trying to train AI to find and filter job applications on various job boards and just whitelist & flag-delete the rest of the email. 

In terms of actually playing with/in the game to hire me, or potentially the dozens of other candidates who might want to play in this game to build a fire-hire-work Match Making asychronous conversational chat robot.  Companies or recruiters wishing to hire me are going to need to pay for the interview.  

Resume: 


documents, fill out, Get paid in crypto for doing captchas, job matching. 

Using CandÍ≠µ.‚ÖÜaùï•e will reduce the toil of finding a job and/or finding/hiring people by efficiently electronically processing their questions using an AI technique known as LLM "Large Language Models"
interactive converùï•ional chat-bot for massive reduction in toil
by matching & reviewing preferences and having a simplified install environment is my primary focus.  The intention is to provide a robot that will screen employment opportunities using crowd sourced information.  

The system is free to sign up, you need a github.
