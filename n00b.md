# welcome n00b

I am keen to know your thoughts on my experiment.  You do not need to read the entire thing in one attempt.  I am attempting to articulate the plan & goal for this repo in a laymens technical terms. #Testerrs are wanted! 

My "conventional" resume is http://bit.ly/resume-brianhorakh

This is my candÍ≠µ.‚ÖÜaùï•e find-hire-work assistant concept in development (project of the week, sketch).   collaborative highly technical persons recruiting and find-hire-work app. 

I'm building Candy Date because think this whole hiring finding talent approach is broken and being done ass backwards. 
At least here in Victoria, AU. I think it is broken the way Australian and global companies hire and I want to fix it. 

This document will describe a system for introducing candidates on Candy Dates using public and secret information stored in the version control system known as git & github.

Candy Date is a novel form of future-employee & organization speed-date ritual, reality survivor meets celebrity apprentice - my own personal build a startup exercise.  The startup is designed to enroll people who are seeking to hire it.  The stack listed here is called the Vegemight Stack because i'm building this tool for the Australian job market but it operates on a free-to-play crypto-coins and therefore should also work in other countries.  

The service is presented in this document for non-technical HR people & recruiters what a github README.  In the future more interactive videos and whatnot but the tutorial needs to be built first.  Big companies will probably need to ask your Corporate IT to setup SAML SSO integration with your Microsoft Azure AD domain or at least have access to setup email from an organization domain such as @google.com rather than @gmail.  But offering a plurality of ways to authenticate your agency seeking to hire people and simulatenously help the whole community avoid over-disclosure and fight the growing scourage of smishing, by providing a beacon for organizations to maintain friendly relationships with candidates a small stipend, based on their progression, for taking time to review.  For IT or generally 'engineering' people this is a substantial problem in specialized industries.

* It would be great if hiring & job-board companies also 

üôè apologies, right now all these packages need to be installed by hand as I put together a minimal system 'build up script'.

there is a lot of toil with these systems stacks.  a system stack is a collection of applications that are pre-wired to work together.

this repo contains the candy.date stack

### Systems Compatibility
* long term steps should work on MacOS, arch-linux(android), and Linux including WSL2 on Windows 11 for MVP. 

ü§ì https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

For now rustup is the best method to get started, open a bash/terminal window
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Development in Containers
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers
[vscode:extension/ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers](Install the Extension)


## ERC-20 Non-Exchange Wallet Requirement

This most likely won't work with the coinbase or exchange wallet(s) so people plan to use metamask.  
I will not write a complete "how to keep your wallet safe" right now, but suffice to say this will be a high security audited project so good systems documentation is important. 

## ShortCut:

The ```cargo run``` command is // TODO!
The ```cargo test``` command is // TODO! 


cargo run will:
    * use youki https://rustrepo.com/repo/utam0k-youki // Experimental implementation of the oci-runtime in Rust
    * attempt to start a application webserver 
    * that will attempt to connect to github
        * store credentials in your github & a git under a fork of this repo.
