Even non-programmers will be needed to build this system, and build out it's synapses with regional hiring jargon & nomenclature.  

Recruiters who are hiring people can represent employers (with permission of course).

I want to make this technically easy at the same time security and plugin nicely to all the existing systems. 

Especially people who do HR or Recruiting tasks for a living, or anybody who is technical that is looking for a new or better job role and would rather than the AI autoresponder feel the sting of rejection. 

A need functional assesment model - regional questions of industry specific jargon (such as "office in CBD" for Melbourne VIC, AU) regional ways to categorize communities and clarifications by language models to ensure they are properly aligned and performing accurately & efficiently. 

Examples of commutes and make better decisions, questions and answers that are selected by employers to assess candidates as Alpha & Beta validation testers for the system. 



Communication mechanisms, coordination, this is roughly my plan.

* expressions of interest
    - get early access & extra coins by donating before our AirDrop
    - send amounts as small as 0.01 ETH, MATIC (Polygon), or DODS (Polkadot) to the address above
    - there will be another address for SOL as I get a bit closer
    - getting some trivial amount of current will really help me explain to the wife that people are 'pre-registering'



* DAO partners
    - keen/expect to work with one or more DAO's, DAO coins welcome (ERC-20)
    - this is intended to a be a way to introduce traditional companies to DAO governance

# Task/Test:  Can you join Discord? Matrix.Org? 
Sometimes describing something is boring and its easier to just get in and learn something new.  People are averse to trying anything new, yet we all know that technology is held back by a small grop of laggards.   

# Task/Test: Can you setup an ERC-20 wallet & GIT credential vault to store it?
I think this will be the biggest test.  I'm going to setup the game so people MUST generate a wallet and proper security, but there is a version of the onboarding that doesn't have this requirement and does the wallet step later. 

# Task/Test: Do employers & employees want this? 
What if there was a find-hire-work tool that let a technical candidate say "I don't want to work for laggards anyway"  and eliminate them from the entire process through selection bias.  Laggards systems are usually full of security issues & undocumented spaghetti code & configs.  Nobody who is technical wants to work for a laggard unless it has a giant paycheck because it's equivalent to poisoning your synapses with obsolete proprietary information. 

So now what needs to happen? I'll be doing some surveys once people get up.  I need some advisors and will do some surveys.  People who answer surveys get Candy Date game coins airdrops.  contribute, share, earn coins.  join Discord, emoji voting for #governance earns coin.  Twitter Polls, and other engagement tools. all those earn coins.   Certain environments like discord have features such as emojis in chat which can be used for voting and governance of an organization.
