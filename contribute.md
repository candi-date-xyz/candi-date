* expressions of interest
    - get early access & extra coins by donating before our AirDrop
    - send amounts as small as 0.01 ETH, MATIC (Polygon), or DODS (Polkadot) to the address above
    - there will be another address for SOL as I get a bit closer. 


* DAO partners
    - keen/expect to work with one or more DAO's, DAO coins welcome (ERC-20)
    - this is intended to a be a way to introduce traditional companies to DAO governance
