## 15-May-2022

a new project when I didn't finish my others. my goal is to run over this while co-planning the mvp. this journal is intended to keep myself sane.

the wife doesn't approve or support me working on anything novel.  she is in a bad headspace and thinks i should learn ruby or pickup java so i can work in a technologically backwards australian company.  australian technology companies (like the ones in the US) are non-existant, the way things are done here is very horse-buggy and I'm trained up to build tractors.  henry ford said "if I asked the customer what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse".

i won't be able to find a job until i have a more recent project, so this seemed like a way to have a recent project.  

i am so sick of the rejection and time wasted looking for employment, it's so inefficient. if I can solve the hiring-somebody & finding-a-job dance (which is fundamentally broken for even moderately technical positions). 

the way hiring is done (at least in Australia) is fundamentally broken (from an american perspective).  

if i don't find a job at some point it's going to break up my marriage.
(and it's not even like we need the money) but the stress of not having employment, up and down and getting rejected .. it's unpleasant.  so this is perhaps designed to ease that burned.
