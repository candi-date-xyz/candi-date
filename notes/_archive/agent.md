The bot-facilitated conversation is asynchronous, answer once, it gets paid for parrot the answer with high confidence in the future, meaning that both party has time to consider their response in a slow-conversation that might happen over days or weeks (based on the duration of the epoch).  The goals of the system is intended to someday provide a universal basic income UBI for people (the "yei") who contribute & audit the software crypto-cyberspace DAO organizational structure which can be a bit much for people who do not follow the space.  It seeks to be a good-will ambassador & onboarding tool for the Polygon L2, Polkadot and Solana blockchains.   People who are employed and looking for a better job can buy tokens as a way to engage with prospective employers for an assessment/validation or rejection pass-fail summary or score within a batch of candidates "speed interviewing" as a group in cycles known as epochs or hash generations of the game which are tied to various indigenous clocks, iteratively timed exercises.  The game at this point is in a seed stage to build the system and promise everybody who participates in the discussion by commenting future coins to play the machine.  I have a nominal six-figure budget to build the system over the next few weeks & months and am keen to have anybody who is looking for a few extra bucks to consider joining the team as a validator.
