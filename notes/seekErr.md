# seekErrs are looking for jobs

^--- Candy Date .. Candꭵ.ⅆa𝕥e(tm) may you find what you seek. 


😍 Getting rejected while hiring sucks.  Investing the time is distracting.  Interviewing is a full time unpaid job, going through the application, then getting rejected or never hearing back, what is the status blabla, such and such couldn't make xyz meeting blabla. It's bullsh*t. So this coin-operated machine is a crypto-graphic "Staked" (🥩) system, which means it's pay at the end (after success), honor policy as a way to encourage participation in good-faith, explaining to HR/Recruiters is the primary audience who will read this email, getting referred here from my Job/Spam email filter / offering back with a crypto-api driven AI Auto-Responder &  screening service.  

The rationale for staking is that it will inheriently prevent spam.  When a system is entirely free to use then it tends to be abused.   As long as both parties are fairly exchanging information equitably then neither party should necessarily be expected to pay, however if the interview is very one sided then that party ought to be paying. 


If the person arriving here is an engineering student, or have skill in WASM interoperability between { Python, TypeScript Vue/3, Rust } systems interfaces this repository is accepting [contribute.md] to participate.  This will consume & scan social profiles to see companies who are hiring and engage them for coins.  The entire system includes a personal bot-driven synaptic data-storage & key-recovery mechanism (personal information management, journal) that acts as an interactive intellectual match-maker for a wide variety of technical positions (candidate & company attribute based survey screening & social pairing, potentially a reality-tv show)

If netflix, or amazon, or disney wanted to setup a candꭵ.ⅆa𝕥e they would fork this template and create a public version of this at their public github and add their company name to the root such as:
```
/disney

```
