## Crypto: Tokenomics
Both systems trade DOTS and LOLE's based on the acceptance or rejectance/outcome of matchings.  LOLE's limited or long term engagements LOLE's (üç≠) measure a date from the time of the first auto-response, a public record of employment of a mutually agreed upon deadline, and subsequent re-negotiation tool that ensures pay equity within a group but also selects one or more winners and losers, with the losers.  DOTS refers to Polkadot a cross-chain 

 This is intended to be an AI Generative Language Model driven crypto-coin driven Word-Token find-hire-work application/technology stack - "interactive assistant & autoresponder" 

Setup a free Github Account to sign up & engage/submit issues.
The first epoch will be bringing structure and detail to this project.  I plan to use Rust/Cargo WASM run in Deno-containers so this setup needs to be opinionated.  Ultimately it's something that will be in the microsoft windows store as a WSL2 image/distribution.

I'm presently working on a http://vscode.dev approach to deploy an individual vault-secured AI Large Language Module auto-responder for job solicitation & auto-responder matching interface. 

It's an onboarding process that gets a person enrolled into a company (so for example on discord, or tweets them about a job, this is an engagement auto-responder)

This is a novel Machine learning stack, inspired from my earlier attempt at _b00t_ this version is built principally on the RUST / WASM language using some Python and TypeScript, that estabishes a github security vault to store cryptographic coin ERC-20 wallet keys.  (ERC-20: is a standard type of crypto-currency wallet that is compatible with browsers via the metamask software.) 



This is an application for crypto-staked funding to an ERC-20 wallet address (to describe that at some point you create a wallet, sign with it, and funds are deposited to operate the find-hire-work game "Candy Date" targeting crypto-coins for liquidity & consensus stages across 3x different networks ({ETH2 MATIC DOTS}) - this most likely won't work with the coinbase wallet(s) - plan to use metamask.  (and initially my work here is on helping people get the environment auto-builds setup to run -- and making this available in the various microsoft, android, chrome, linux distribution and apple appstores)



The AI natural language processing ("NLP") module grants episodic seeker coins based on feedback from the daterr at each round the game both parties may decide to continue one or more paths to form a Long or Lean Engagement LOLE.üç≠ (employment), or go on other dates.  While people can always create a new wallet, start over there is a factor of LUCK.üçÄ which accures the longer an individual is playing and the more identity information they give over to the agent.   These coins roughly churn into different formats and while it isn't explicitly gambling there are concepts borrowed from a Freemium business model to keep the application & network sustainable.
