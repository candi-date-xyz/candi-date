# Introduction


## Risks

The commands to setup the system with-ease would require non-technical operators should not hire one or more consultants or utilize resources inside their own organization to enter profiles.   


Anybody should be able to run the whole thing in your browser or install to your PC using WASM.   

What you as perhaps a non-technical HR person won't know how to setup k8s or so this tutorial is designed to be run on an individual PC or target device.   The root of the game is having people post their 

The bot-facilitated conversation is asynchronous, answer once, it gets paid for parrot the answer with high confidence in the future, meaning that both party has time to consider their response in a slow-conversation that might happen over days or weeks (based on the duration of the epoch).  The goals of the system is intended to someday provide a universal basic income UBI for people (the "yei") who contribute & audit the software crypto-cyberspace DAO organizational structure which can be a bit much for people who do not follow the space.  It seeks to be a good-will ambassador & onboarding tool for the Polygon L2, Polkadot and Solana blockchains.   People who are employed and looking for a better job can buy tokens as a way to engage with prospective employers for an assessment/validation or rejection pass-fail summary or score within a batch of candidates "speed interviewing" as a group in cycles known as epochs or hash generations of the game which are tied to various indigenous clocks, iteratively timed exercises.  The game at this point is in a seed stage to build the system and promise everybody who participates in the discussion by commenting future coins to play the machine.  I have a nominal six-figure budget to build the system over the next few weeks & months and am keen to have anybody who is looking for a few extra bucks to consider joining the team as a validator. 

‚õ≤ FounTional : A Repo is technical documentation for a piece of software that you install on your computer, usually in roles which  correspond with via email "recruiter <=> agent <=> company" dynamic of the hiring process.  That is the target audience "lithmus test" for question, time to response, age of account, authenticity of offer (having to stake crypto currency upon a successful outcome with an arbiter Human supervised-AI agent making decisions)

This is  to be reading about or interested in learing how to play "Candy Date" .  filter to determine the likelyhood of a good match selecting staking crypto to do your exercises and offering to share the result for others who may want to administratively review the feedback instead of properly characterizing the state of your Tech Stack internal systems or desires or aspirations.  For candidates, it is a public recognition of which interviews process is broken and one-sided.  For employers, it is an opinionated explanation of how you should be indexing & archiving your job requirements.   You upload your encrypted CV of qualifications or perform tutorials and small exercises. 

This is a technical recruiting application, so it requires some coordination to understand that it is designed to run on your computer, or via a website in your browser our on device. 

 This github, is where you can submit your digital requirements.
 Each time, each party gives an answer.  The answers, profiles, and other data must be verified which service do you want to validate first and linking identities to the wallets of these coins as historical validators for key-shard identity recovery.   Their interest in the long term success of the outcome by validating the decision (such as employment, but possibly others).  Negligible appearance & gratuity payment is gifted crypto-currency for the participation in the live-fire tutorial.  Pay people to give references and use intentional AI LLM model to arrange a date using fictional presently but intended to be real-money equivalent in-game crypto-currency Web3 application. 
 
 This is a bit of Social Art experiment. If written as a novel hopes to proffer a solution of offering coins for data as social capital & value of social data to simplify the match making with me, and *hopefully* other technical candidates who would like to improve the job-seeking experience.  But I'm not making this as a political statement or whatever, other than to say I think this system will work better for technical candidates to become 
 
 For the technically minded people, this is a poly-stack self-installing coin-operated HR hiring & match making system where I/we/yei "the collective us" must pay employers or agents in crypto-coin as bounties/incentives to address my bot instead of me and help them screen me/others better.  Each person runs their own agent, and such that it must ultimately support a wide variety  "plurality" of devices to be successful requires a bit of plumbing and tooling so I need to explain the reason I'm asking people to install my resume. /üòâüòú (at least that is the goal, to ask employers to provide details to an ai llm agent that attempts to match other seekers with a qualified position.) 
 
 The CandÍ≠µ.‚ÖÜaùï•e(tm) functional compiler system is built on the honor policy, you pay people in crypto to read your job based on the preferences & goals they have stated match-making service.  The network pays for successful authentication disclosure, captchas and other nuisances so everybody can earn a few tokens easily.  You must/have or generate an organizational ERC-20 wallet, and you may be asked to provide one or more forms of qualification disclosure (paid de-encryption of matching recruitment data to your needs)

 All the software and requirements in this are FREE to download, there is no cost, the software runs on your computer or in your browser. 
 
/ü§ì "Melvin" represents technical specifications that may not be relevant or difficult to understand outside of knowledge in a specific field.  This system is designed to introduce new skills to the user to play the game as part of an interactive find-aidmmt-hire-work politely named err$ (produced like Errors)

nerd As mentioned in this document will have links appear when this is commited using an RUST cargo action, documentation generation.  Markdown++ is the documentation format with ornamentation for entertainment. 

 This requires people download VS-Code is opinionated dev environment for live-share coding & problem solving exercises & pre-interview and interview transcription q&a pre-screen typewriter with a button that says "ask" and you write a question and it provides better fitment of candidates during Candy Date recruiting exercises. 
 
 Reputation is built by professional operators who screen DALLE-2 driven models for companies they represent in initial screening interviews & ongoing work-from-home or office complex negotiation engagement that is modern post COVID society but also cyber-safety screening.  Recruiting data storage in IT Recruiting & Corporate HR IT systems is usually absolutely horrid so the network will pay them in crypto-currenty to answer profile questions, and they will pay the same coins asynchronously.  People could maintain as many identities as they want professionally and this has the added advantage of long term crypto-key vault recovery 'horcrux' identity sharding.  For now, this REPO will store your secure information in a system known as github git identity private vault.  To do this:

# Steps
 * Setup, github, clone this repo as template - install windows WSL-2 or equivalent command line containerized environment. 

 * Once you have logged into github and made a clone of this repo.  Install VS

 
 Linking crypto wallets and ending the toil of clown coding exercises letting several companies participate in a hiring cycle offering crypto-bounties to their projects. Potentially wager on your mates by providing validation of high level details (reference checks, etc.) for my mates who I've worked with over the years or are seeing this on my LinkedIn profile - this is intended to be a disruptive prototype. ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: If you are in the recruiting-industry you are here playing with disruptive dynamite right now! üß®

 Free to use and payment is strictly on the honor policy in the way the game is played.   The application itself uses the git protocol hash from the log of emoji feedback as a way to index & reward participation. This is common on sites like discord and in organizations. 

I will now attempt to explain that which does not yet exist. 
Please bear with me.  Why I am building this, the audience and how it will be used concurrently.  The types of people who may use this application are technical people who are keen to do tasks or are looking for work. 

üòç Getting rejected while hiring sucks.  Investing the time is distracting.  Interviewing is a full time unpaid job, going through the application, then getting rejected or never hearing back, what is the status blabla, such and such couldn't make xyz meeting blabla. It's bullsh*t. So this coin-operated machine is a crypto-graphic "Staked" (ü•©) system, which means it's pay at the end (after success), honor policy as a way to encourage participation in good-faith, explaining to HR/Recruiters is the primary audience who will read this email, getting referred here from my Job/Spam email filter / offering back with a crypto-api driven AI Auto-Responder &  screening service.   

This is planned as an oregon trail CLI driven system, that can run on any computer or device for universal accessibility with each device having a different role for a many-factor authentication "Mfa" custodial crypto-currency wallets for beginners Gentle Introduction to build your own AI Autoresponder HOWTO. 

Dear Recruiters, I will pay you in crypto-currency to answer these questions and screen these emails better, with a higher degree of word precision and with less repetition (the answers don't change, so this does a better job screening, asynchronously via chat)

 Where companies and employees can upload their encrypted profiles, link their organizational accounts, and have bi-directional robots converstationally take turns in successive-rounds finding and eliminating candidates until a position is filled. 

Don't worry, it's easy to use because everybody starts with 1,000 free tokens sponsored by "Candy Date" Crypto Coin co. a command line driven "cli" / interactive menu driven/run on your own machine. 

You can power the system and generate coins by joining and it is mostly explained below. 

CandÍ≠µ.‚ÖÜaùï•e is a conversational AI that simplifies the review &
processing of both job advertisements and CVs.  In development, it will be operated collectively using this repository and other founTional ("‚õ≤") (founTional: an amaglamation of functional-technical documentation) providing "Sources of Truth" for the stack described herein, how to operate said machine on your own computer, and to take you through the steps of setting up an ERC-20 wallet, and trying to automate as much tedium as possible.  I and possibly others will gladly pay companies to properly screen these opportunities and protect my data & privacy.   The present online recruiting model requires too much disclosure on the candidate and CandÍ≠µ.‚ÖÜaùï•e hopes to fix that by speeding up the "is role a fit" answering simple questions about roles or jobs you represent. 

The intention of this ‚õ≤ README.md is to serve as a guide-post to the systems source contained inside this repository.  It is to provide a employee-employer block-chain cryptocoin-operated "Freemium" incentivized that can be run & mine its coins on your computer as a "paid to play" for performing nominal inference tasks such as captchas.  HR Authentication & on-boarding systems checklist "Candy Date" match-making service for finding & hiring highly techincal people. 
 
 You, yei, we: The player, will receive coins for multi-factor authenticating and verifying identities, providing validation & exit-interview crypto-wallet & proof of employment contract in the form of an ERC-771 smart-contract, discussion facilitation.  Disclosure requires all parties such as work history and targeting the information with various disclosure levels in a negotiation crowd-sourced hiring.  
 
 As an individual looking for a technical work-remote job - I'm tired of giving up all this information blindly to proprietary job apps.   If you want to make copies that's fine, but my job application from here on is here. 
 
 .  At some point when this is finished, this is a cargo and ios.üçé/windows/android.-linux/mac package install

This is a new method of recruiting that requires groups of people (non-scientists, non-system engineers) to be able to setup the tool to prove that it works is another feat entirely.  So this document will define the goals

A crypto-paid bounty & multi-party ETH/Polygon L2 encrypted blockchain record & book keeping negotation system employee-employer work-for-hire match making and data-classification performance analysis system. 

Information is presented in a venacular to potential business & for-hire candidates using CandÍ≠µ.‚ÖÜaùï•e the "latest" (latest: "next idea") processing gamified "find-hire-work = win scenario" system real crypto-job token/game setup interface as an auto-responder to 
my inboxes and trying to train AI to find and filter job applications on various job boards and just whitelist & flag-delete the rest of the email. 

In terms of actually playing with/in the game to hire me, or potentially the dozens of other candidates who might want to play in this game to build a fire-hire-work Match Making asychronous conversational chat robot.  Companies or recruiters wishing to hire me are going to need to pay for the interview.  

Resume: 


documents, fill out, Get paid in crypto for doing captchas, job matching. 

Using CandÍ≠µ.‚ÖÜaùï•e will reduce the toil of finding a job and/or finding/hiring people by efficiently electronically processing their questions using an AI technique known as LLM "Large Language Models"
interactive converùï•ional chat-bot for massive reduction in toil
by matching & reviewing preferences and having a simplified install environment is my primary focus.  The intention is to provide a robot that will screen employment opportunities using crowd sourced information.  

The system is free to sign up, you need a github.
