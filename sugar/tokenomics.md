This is an application for crypto-staked funding to an ERC-20 wallet address (to describe that at some point you create a wallet, sign with it, and funds are deposited to operate the find-hire-work game "Candy Date" targeting crypto-coins for liquidity & consensus stages across 3x different networks ({ETH2 MATIC DOTS}) - this most likely won't work with the coinbase wallet(s) - plan to use metamask.  (and initially my work here is on helping people get the environment auto-builds setup to run -- and making this available in the various microsoft, android, chrome, linux distribution and apple appstores)



The AI natural language processing ("NLP") module grants episodic seeker coins based on feedback from the daterr at each round the game both parties may decide to continue one or more paths to form a Long or Lean Engagement LOLE.üç≠ (employment), or go on other dates.  While people can always create a new wallet, start over there is a factor of LUCK.üçÄ which accures the longer an individual is playing and the more identity information they give over to the agent.   These coins roughly churn into different formats and while it isn't explicitly gambling there are concepts borrowed from a Freemium business model to keep the application & network sustainable.
