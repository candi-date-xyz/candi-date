# The VegeMight Stack!
Technical Stack Proposed is POLYglot (many to many language binding):
* WASM
    * Web Assembly allows libraries written in one language to be used in another
* RUST:
    * cargo package manager install/initialization 
    * https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge
        * Embed a Wasm function in your Node.js, Go, Rust, or C app
* TypeScript: serverless deno containers
    * podman oci 
* Python: data-processing & machine learning
    * conda & pytorch 




The commands to setup the system with-ease would require non-technical operators should not hire one or more consultants or utilize resources inside their own organization to enter profiles.   

Anybody should be able to run the whole thing in your browser or install to your PC using WASM.   

What you as perhaps a non-technical HR person won't know how to setup k8s or so this tutorial is designed to be run on an individual PC or target device.   The root of the game is having people post their 

 As mentioned in this document will have links appear when this is commited using an RUST cargo action, documentation generation.  Markdown++ is the documentation format with ornamentation for entertainment. 

 This requires people download VS-Code is opinionated dev environment for live-share coding & problem solving exercises & pre-interview and interview transcription q&a pre-screen typewriter with a button that says "ask" and you write a question and it provides better fitment of candidates during Candy Date recruiting exercises. 
 






## governance
* This system will use many-factor authentication systems

* TODO: add WIP badge
* TODO: add cargo test cases, podman, deno, cargo

- how to include crates? (submodules)

# ü¶Ä.RUST
* all things rust have a crab emoji
* It would be great if some DAO organizations could pledge some collateral to help establish an 
organization if you want to use this and build your own interface, especially need Rust, Python, TypeScript will be the stack

# üêç.PYTHON
# syntax/python.py__üç¨üêç
* all things python have a snake emoji
* presently using spack vs. code
* included MVP of a language transformer auto-responder. 

# ü¶Ñ.TYPESCRIPT
* all things typescript have a unicorn
