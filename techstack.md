# The VegeMight Stack!

* minimum tooling expectation(s), everything here is open source
  & free (+ donations *if* we make something profitable)

This repo contains the foundations of the VegeMight Stack ("VMs") for Errs "üëΩ" the agent inside Candy Date (explained below).  

A stack is a collection of tools which are pre-oriented/configured as a starting point.  By designing the software architecture as a 'stack' it fuses many layers of technologies together into a single pre-configured package/container that becomes a shared starting point making it architecturally easier to discuss.  VMs is a nod to 'virtual machines'. 

VMs is a poly-platform dev kit & operating environment - with a bias for SSO security, setup & admin of cloud services, to operate cognitive agency (machine learning) &  data-engineering, along with dependencies for using blockchains for decentralized coordination/ERC-20 wallet integration.  

VMs is highly opinionated about many things.  The use RUST/cargo crates orchestration and WASM to access other languages within.  TypeScript/Vue3+Vite for UI/UX interfaces & Python for machine learning, and Bash, Go, C++, et al. as required. Solang/Solidity for eBPF, WASM smart-contracts. VS-Code as a preferred editor / operating environment. 

VMs embraces a neo-modern code-pattern of WASM + deno. It uses podman instead of docker for it's OCI and will use minimal k8s (if at all). 

WASM is a structural pillar of VMs which hopes to promote interoperability and reusability of code between different languages.  VMs hopes to provide a more detailed example of how to build complex things than 'hello-world'.  However the people who may be using VMs are expected to be beginning to advanced engineers and Candy Date may help them after finishing school. 

For that reason this repo is designed as a git-template so it can be forked, copied, and will be copiously commented about decisions & configurations as an idiomatic tutorial of advanced technologies.   A Polyglot stack, many languages, many libraries, and in this example also polcy-cloud but scales down to be self-hosted using only open-source software and free services.  

VMs is a self contained (but also very cloud-deploy ready) code & binary packaging system for "Candy Date". 
 


# Bullet List of Choices

Technical Stack Proposed is POLYglot (many to many language binding):
* WASM
    * Web Assembly allows libraries written in one language to be used in another
* RUST:
    * cargo package manager install/initialization 
    * https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge
        * Embed a Wasm function in your Node.js, Go, Rust, or C app
* TypeScript: serverless deno containers
    * podman oci 
* Python: data-processing & machine learning
    * conda & pytorch 



# Steps
 * Setup, github, clone this repo as template - install windows WSL-2 or equivalent command line containerized environment. 




The commands to setup the system with-ease would require non-technical operators should not hire one or more consultants or utilize resources inside their own organization to enter profiles.   

Anybody should be able to run the whole thing in your browser or install to your PC using WASM.   

What you as perhaps a non-technical HR person won't know how to setup k8s or so this tutorial is designed to be run on an individual PC or target device.   The root of the game is having people post their 

 As mentioned in this document will have links appear when this is commited using an RUST cargo action, documentation generation.  Markdown++ is the documentation format with ornamentation for entertainment. 

 This requires people download VS-Code is opinionated dev environment for live-share coding & problem solving exercises & pre-interview and interview transcription q&a pre-screen typewriter with a button that says "ask" and you write a question and it provides better fitment of candidates during Candy Date recruiting exercises. 
 






## governance
* This system will use many-factor authentication systems

* TODO: add WIP badge
* TODO: add cargo test cases, podman, deno, cargo

- how to include crates? (submodules)

# ü¶Ä.RUST
* all things rust have a crab emoji
* It would be great if some DAO organizations could pledge some collateral to help establish an 
organization if you want to use this and build your own interface, especially need Rust, Python, TypeScript will be the stack

# üêç.PYTHON
# syntax/python.py__üç¨üêç
* all things python have a snake emoji
* presently using spack vs. code
* included MVP of a language transformer auto-responder. 

# ü¶Ñ.TYPESCRIPT
